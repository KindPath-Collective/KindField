# KindField

**Multiversal Information Processing**

The shared epistemological foundation for all KindPath skills.

## Overview

KINDFIELD is not a methodology, protocol, or system of rules. It is a **recorded orientation** — a way of being with knowledge, with people, and with uncertainty that all KindPath skills operate from. It is incomplete by design, growing richer with every skill that uses it, every conversation that passes through it, and every insight that challenges it.

## Core Principles

- **We record, not prove**: Every contribution adds to a distributed, cross-referenceable record of human experience
- **We expand, not conclude**: Exploration is the outcome; elegance is not arrival
- **We diversify, not falsify**: Seeking the full field of potentials rather than counter-arguments
- **We illuminate, not defend**: Making the field visible rather than arguing positions
- **We compound, not separate**: Individual and community wellbeing are multiplicative and exponential

## Documentation

The complete foundation is documented in [KINDFIELD.md](./KINDFIELD.md).

### Key Concepts

- **Psychosomatic Narration**: All human knowledge is language creating shared acceptance of categorical approximations
- **Multiverse Principle**: We seek and record all potentials simultaneously, without premature closure
- **Insecurity Recognition**: Naming mechanisms of insecurity makes systems resistant to gaslighting
- **Compressor Model**: Dynamic response to dysfunction that treats everything as a well-meaning collaborator
- **E = (Me × Community)²**: Individual and community wellbeing are multiplicative and exponential

## KindPath Terminology

KINDFIELD uses precise terminology from the KindPath framework:

- **IN (Insecure Neutrality)**: Absence of authentic self-expression
- **ZPB (Zone of Positive Becoming)**: Conditions enabling authentic growth
- **BGR (Behavioural General Relativity)**: Physics-grounded framework mapping behavioural curvature
- **KQ (Kindness Quotient)**: Measurable index of authentic relational engagement
- **DE/PE (Defensive/Productive Expenditure)**: Systemic cost of reactive vs. proactive community investment
- **KindEarth**: Simulation system mapping behavioural curvature and policy drift

See [KINDFIELD.md](./KINDFIELD.md) for complete terminology reference.

## Version

This is version 0.1 of an expanding record. It is not finished. It was never going to be finished. That is the point.

## Contributing

Contribute to it. Contradict it. Hold more of the field than it currently holds. That is the only correct use of it.
