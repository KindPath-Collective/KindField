# Contributing to KindField

Thank you for your interest in contributing to KINDFIELD. This document provides guidance on how to engage with this living epistemological foundation.

## Understanding the Nature of This Project

KINDFIELD is not a traditional software project or static documentation. It is a **living field of recorded potential** that grows through contribution, contradiction, and expansion. Your contribution is not subject to traditional "acceptance criteria" — it is a valid addition to the multiverse of perspectives we are recording.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Expand the Field

Add perspectives, contexts, or interpretations that we are not yet seeing. This includes:

- Alternative readings of existing concepts
- Cultural or contextual framings from different traditions
- Examples of how these principles manifest in practice
- Contradictions that reveal blind spots in the current articulation

### 2. Record Experience

Share how engaging with KINDFIELD principles has manifested in your work, community, or personal practice:

- Case studies of skills operating from this foundation
- Observations about what works and what doesn't
- Documentation of awkwardness, friction, or failure
- Insights gained from applying these orientations

### 3. Identify Insecurity Patterns

Help name where this foundation itself operates from insecurity:

- Premature conclusions we've made
- Confirmation architectures we've built
- Binary mechanisms we've fallen into
- Places where the language coerces rather than invites

### 4. Improve Clarity

Suggest refinements to language, structure, or examples that make the field more accessible without reducing its complexity:

- Grammatical improvements
- Structural reorganization
- Additional examples or metaphors
- Cross-references and navigation aids

## How to Submit Contributions

### For Documentation Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch describing your contribution (e.g., `expand-compressor-model` or `add-indigenous-perspective`)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear description of what you're adding to the field
   - Context for why this perspective matters
   - How it relates to or challenges existing articulations

### For Substantial Expansions

If your contribution represents a major expansion of the field:

1. Open an issue first to discuss the scope
2. Describe what potentials you're seeking to record
3. Share early drafts or outlines
4. Engage with feedback as additional perspectives, not as gatekeeping

## Review Process

The review process is not about approval or rejection. It is about:

- **Ensuring diversity is preserved**: We don't collapse multiple readings into single interpretations
- **Maintaining precision in terminology**: KindPath terms are used consistently and accurately
- **Recording friction**: Disagreements and contradictions are documented, not resolved
- **Compounding perspectives**: Your contribution adds to the field; it doesn't replace what's there

## Principles for Engagement

### We Seek the Widest Spread

Your contribution becomes more valuable through diversity of interpretation, not through protection of a single "correct" reading.

### We Welcome Contradiction

If you disagree with something in KINDFIELD, that disagreement is valuable data. Contribute it.

### We Hold Awkwardness

If your contribution feels awkward, unclear, or not-quite-right, that is signal. Include that recognition.

### We Avoid Premature Closure

Resist the urge to "resolve" tensions or "conclude" questions. The multiverse holds contradiction without collapse.

## Code of Conduct

Engagement with this project should embody the principles it articulates:

- Operate from genuine curiosity rather than defensive posture
- Record and name insecurity patterns when they arise (including your own)
- Treat all participants as well-meaning collaborators shaped by their context
- Commit deeply while holding commitments as living things that grow and change
- Illuminate rather than argue; expand rather than conclude

## Questions?

If you're unsure how to contribute or whether your perspective fits:

1. It fits. The question itself is data about the current state of the field.
2. Open an issue describing your uncertainty.
3. The conversation that follows is itself a contribution.
